## Machine_Learning_Techinques
Tasks for Machine Learning Techinques Course in ITMO University.

#### 1. Classifiers
* The first task was to train, test and evaluate four different models.
The four different trained classifiers are:
1. Small decision tree
2. Deep decision tree
3. Random forest on small trees
4. Random forest on deep trees
* Evaluating each model individualy was done by calculating some metrics (precision;recall; accuracy; F1-score; log-loss;) and by ploting precision-recall 
and ROC curves for each model.
* The second task was to train a classifier that avoids Type II (False Negative) errors
and calculate different metrics to evaluate it. By avoiding Type II errors, it means that the recall for that algorithm should be greater than 0.95

#### 4. Natural Language Processing
*	The data analyzed is the story of Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll from Project Gutenberg's website http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-0.txt.
*	First of all necessary preprocessing tasks are performed on the text: converting to lower case, removing stop words, numbers / non-alphabetic characters, lemmatization.
*	The first task is to find Top 10 most important words (excluding the word 'Alice') from each chapter in the, in terms of TF-IDF metric.
Then trying to name each chapter according to the identified tokens?
*	The second task is to find the Top 10 most used verbs in sentences with Alice. And concluding what does alice do the most.
